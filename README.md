# mssqlclient-ng

Enhanced version of impacket's mssqlclient.py, based on the core [tds.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/impacket/tds.py). It lets you interact with Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL / MSSQL) servers and their linked instances, impersonating any account encountered along the way, without requiring complex T-SQL queries.
