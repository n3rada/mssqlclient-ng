Enhanced version of impacket's `mssqlclient.py`. It lets you interact with Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL / MSSQL) servers and their linked instances, impersonating any account encountered along the way, without requiring complex T-SQL queries.

> [!TIP]
> If you have only access to a MS SQL instance through your implant/beacon, use [MSSQLand](https://github.com/n3rada/MSSQLand), the `C#` version built with assembly execution in mind. 

## üì¶ Installation

To install `mssqlclient-ng`, you can use `pip`, `pip3` or `pipx`. Either from `pypi` repository or from `GitHub` source. Prefer using [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), since it install Python applications in isolated virtual environments.

### From [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mssqlclientng/)

```bash
pipx install mssqlclientng
```

```bash
pip install mssqlclientng
```

### From GitHub

```bash
pipx install 'git+https://github.com/n3rada/mssqlclient-ng.git'
```

Interract with Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL | MSSQL) servers and their linked instances, without the need for complex T-SQL queries.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             Show version and exit.

  -d, --domain DOMAIN   Domain name
  -db, --database DATABASE
                        MSSQL database instance (default None)
  -l, --links LINKS     Comma-separated list of linked servers to chain (e.g., 'SQL02:user,SQL03,SQL04:admin')

Credentials:
  Options for credentials

  -u, --username USERNAME
                        Username (either local or Windows).

  --kdcHost KDCHOST     FQDN of the domain controller. If omitted it will use the domain part (FQDN) specified in the target parameter

Connection:
  -dc-ip ip address     IP Address of the domain controller. If ommited it use the domain part (FQDN) specified in the target parameter
  -target-ip ip address
                        IP Address of the target machine. If omitted it will use whatever was specified as target. This is useful when target is the NetBIOS name and you cannot resolve it

### Chain Through Linked Servers

Avoid typing out all those **[RPC Out](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sql/t-sql/functions/openquery-transact-sql)** or **[OPENQUERY](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sql/t-sql/functions/openquery-transact-sql)** calls manually:

```bash
mssqlclientng SQLDEV.box -u 'jacquard' -p 'FQqU^XQ-*|xcv' -windows-auth -l "SQL02,SQL03:admin,SQL04"
```
